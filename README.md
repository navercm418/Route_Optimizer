Python3 Script using tkinter Gui

Optimize a list of addresses by driving distances

Enter "Start" address
Enter "End" address

Add the rest of the addresses to the list box, one address per line.
Address format should be [street address],[city],[state]
  example:  123 Main st, Somewhere, NY

Click "Optimize" and the list of addresses will be sorted by driving distance top to bottom.
Addresses with errors will not be included in the optimized list, they will be printed below the sorted address list.
The last line is a url for Google Maps of the sorted address list.
